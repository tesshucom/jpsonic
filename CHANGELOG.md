  * [fix] Fix the bug that only specific pattern queries are skipped in UPnP search.
    Improved song search using artist/composer as key.
  * [update] Change the sort-tag-rearrangement process of after scan.
    Merge processing when there are multiple sort-tags in one name has been changed to stricter processing.
     - In addition to album, artist, albumArtist sort-tags, composer is included in the target.
     - In the case of the sort tag of the person name, it takes precedence in the order of changeDate/albumArtist/artist/composer.
     - In the case of the sort tag of album name, it takes precedence changeDate.
  * [update] Change the conditions under which sort-tags are used for indexing and sorting.
     - Previously, sort-tags were not used if the first string of name was alphabetic.
     - Changed to use sort tag if name and sort tag start with alphabet and if sort tag contains Japanese.
  * [update] Add a column to keep original sort-tag in DB. Currently it does not provide any new features by itself.
       It is intended for future tag-checkers, or to address the need for users to write and check SQL.

       - RecentAlbums & RecentAlbums(ID3) -> Recently added albums & Recently tagged albums.

  * [update] The UPnP setting screen has been improved so that the relationship between the selected item and the display name can be easily understood.
  * [update] Changed UPnP to not display artist images obtained from external services.
    (The implementation displaying the tag image of ID3 instead is not deleted.)
    Because this is not a proper implementation under Japanese law.
    In later versions, the same policy will also remove images of artists located except for UPnP.
    If a better solution is implemented in the future, it will be modified again to display the image.

        Jpsonic will still make the same automatic assignment.
        If specified port with startup option, will follow it.

<summary>v106.1.1 based on airsonic 10.5.0-RELEASE</summary>

  * [fix] Update Tomcat to 8.5.50 (CVE-2019-12418, CVE-2019-17563).

Critical security fix.
The following measures taken.

 - Update Tomcat version to 8.5.50. The only version that addresses threats now.
 - Stop Tomcat precompiler. Because it depends on 8.5.40. As a result, the initial display of the web screen is slightly slower.
 - Jetty will continue to change to a compilable configuration. However,
   since it does not respond to threats, no official distribution will be made.
   It only supports arbitrary compilation.
