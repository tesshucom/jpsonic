# This is a JPSONIC boot configuration sample in Synology DS220+ or in Linux with UPnP.
# You can easily start Jpsonic by changing the volume, port and so on.

# usage: 
#   docker-compose -f production.synology.yml up -d

# @since v114.0.0

    # Jpsonic container is limited to 1Gb so that it can run on DS220+'s standard memory.
    # Please change this depending on the number of songs in your library.
    # Note that you need to change both Java and Docker memory settings.
