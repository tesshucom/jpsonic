//
// CSS styleshet for the "Jpsonic" theme.
//
// [Constitution]
//
// The JSP is based on Airsonic, but the CSS configuration is very different.
// SCSS is made into parts so that a large-scale design can be designed.
//
// Since there are dependencies, the order of reading is fixed.
// The SCSS that stores the global definition is read first, and the SCSS for each page is read.
//
// jpsonic.scss                     [This file. The order in which the definitions are read is defined.]
//     ├ definitions　               [Definitions used repeatedly, or theme-specific definitions]
//     │     ├ _jp-functions.scss    : Common functions such as borders and effects.
//     │     ├ _jp-icons.scss        : Definitions related to icons.
//     │     ├ _jp-reset.scss        : Based upon 'A modern CSS reset'.
//     │     ├ _jpsonic.scss         : Global variable declaration for 'Jpsonic' theme.
//     │     └ _jp-v109.3.0          : Global definition, that directly extends HTML tags.
//     └ pages
//           └ pages                [Definition for each page of JSP. Global definition overrides and page-dependent definitions.]
//                 ├ _all.scss       : There is no particular content. Links to all files in the pages directory.
//                 ├ _global.scss    : Global definition, that depends on the CSS class used by Jpsonic's JSP.
//                 ├ _dialogs.scss   : Definition that depends on the dialog class of jquery-ui. All dialogs are defined in one file.
//                 └ *.scss          : CSS unique to each page. It corresponds to the web page (JSP).
