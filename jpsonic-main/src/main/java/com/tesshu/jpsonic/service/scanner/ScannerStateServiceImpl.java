/**
 * Service class responsible for managing the runtime state of the scan process,
 * including current execution status and recent scan history.
 * <p>
 * This service centralizes control over various aspects of scanning: whether
 * scanning is currently enabled, whether a scan is in progress, the timestamp
 * of the most recent scan, the total number of executions, and concurrency
 * control through locking. It also serves as a synchronization point for UI
 * components or monitoring services.
 *
 * <h3>Main Responsibilities</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Maintaining and exposing whether scanning is enabled or disabled</li>
 * <li>Determining whether a scan is currently in progress (via reentrant
 * locking)</li>
 * <li>Tracking the timestamp of the most recent scan</li>
 * <li>Counting the total number of scan executions</li>
 * <li>Resetting internal state upon server shutdown</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Design Notes</h3>
 * <p>
 * While {@link ScanContext} holds immutable configuration parameters related to
 * scanning, this class manages mutable runtime state during the scan process.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * To initiate a scan, {@code setReady()} must be called beforehand. This
 * mechanism ensures that scanning cannot begin until the server has completed
 * critical startup routines (e.g., Lucene initialization or mounting host
 * volumes in Docker). These routines could interfere with scanning if allowed
 * to overlap. <br>
 * <br>
 * Classes that execute scans continue to reference this service throughout the
 * scan, but scanning will not begin until readiness is explicitly declared via
 * {@code setReady()}. This mechanism helps enforce safe and controlled scan
 * initiation timing.
 * </p>
