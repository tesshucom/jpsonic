/**
 * Director class for constructing search criteria from HTTP-based search
 * requests.
 * <p>
 * This class primarily handles the interpretation of user input and delegates
 * the creation of Lucene {@link Query} objects to the {@link QueryFactory}. By
 * doing so, it separates the concerns of search criteria construction and query
 * generation, promoting better modularity and maintainability.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code @DependsOn} annotation ensures that this component is initialized
 * only after the {@code queryFactory} and {@code settingsService} beans have
 * been fully initialized, maintaining correct dependency initialization order
 * within the Spring container.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Acting as an entry point to the search subsystem, this class builds
 * {@link HttpSearchCriteria} objects by encapsulating the parsed query along
 * with user-defined parameters such as offset, result count, composer
 * inclusion, and target music folders.
 * </p>
