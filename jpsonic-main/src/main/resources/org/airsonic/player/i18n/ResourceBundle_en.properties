personalsettings.playinganddisplayoutline=Here you can make settings related to music performance and display. Items that have different optimum operations for each device are mainly summarized.<br>There are three typical presets for PC / Tablet / Smartphone. Please change the individual items to your favorite settings according to your environment. For example :<ul><li>Since there are many classical songs, I want to display all the song titles when displaying them on a PC. Make the drawer close automatically.</li><li>I'm using a keyboard connected to my tablet, so enable keyboard shortcuts.</li>Enable speech recognition because using a headset on your PC<li></li></ul>Please note that web viewing for smartphones is not intended to guarantee comfortable playing music. On smartphones, it's definitely more comfortable to have a dedicated native app installed.<br>If you have a recent smartphone with sufficient width, you can use the setting pages. Work is completed without a desktop PC when installing or changing settings.<br>The language set in the default language is used as the voice recognition language, but any language can be assigned. See Google Cloud Language support<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages" target="_blank">Cloud Speech-to-Text\u3000Language support</a>
personalsettings.themeoutline=Here you can set the language and theme.<br>You can switch the display language of the web page by setting the language, but it is also the default for some other language functions. See the setting items of individual features.<ul><li>Biographical language. Biography leverages the capabilities of an external service, Last.fm, but not all languages available in Jpsonic are supported. So there is an option to force the biographical language to English.</li><li>Speech recognition language. It is possible to explicitly specify a language other than the one specified here by option. For example, it is possible to assign English other than GB and US.</li></ul>
